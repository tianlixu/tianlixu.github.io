* Data Sets
  Train/Dev/Test sets
  - Training set
    Use training set on your algorithms
  - Dev - Development set/ Cross Validation set
    Use Dev set to see which of many different models perform best on your dev set, then you get your final model
  - Test set
    Evaluate your model on your test set to get an unbiased estimate of how well your algorithm is doing

** Ratio
   - Small amount of data(100, 1k, 10k), 60%, 20%, and 20% respectively
   - Big data era(> 1M), dev/test are much smaller
     98%, 1%, 1%, or 99.5%, 0.25%, 0.25, or 99.5%, 0.4%, 0.1%

** Mismatched tain/test disriibution
   Rule of thumb:
   - Make sure dev and test sets come from the same distribution.
   - Your training set might come from a different distribution.
   - You might be OK to not have a test set
