I always want to do this and that. Sometimes I do have a plan or todo list, but unfortunatelly I failed most of them and always come up with convincible execuses. Now it's time to change, a "Real Change".  Are you familiar with this - Real Change - what the new Prime Minister promisses to Canadians:)


To start from simple yet achievalbe things:
1. Sleep: early to bed - before 10:30pm for the workdays.

2. Excercise:
   2.1 20 bent knee sit-ups per night
   2.2 Run/Walk 10km per week
   Note: Walking 10,000 steps a day is the best- this means 7km per day. Currently it seems mission impossible for me.

3. Photography: taking one photo per day

4. Reading: Chapter 2,3 and 4 of "Born to Run"

5. Read and reply all the unread emails: eliminate the RED badge number of Gmail app in my cell phone.

Will review this Todo List on next Friday(Oct 30, 2015) night. Look and see.

Review @ November 01, 2015:
1. This seems one mission impossible for me:( Will try it again this week.
2. Almost done.
3. Yes. I did it. Sometimes with my iPhone and sometimes with my Cannon 550D.
4. Done. Yeah!!
5. :( doing it now.
