This is the 1st team outing since I joined the company and this is also my first time to play this kind of laser game which I did enjoy.
The most interesting thing is the staff of Laser Quest always ask us to reapt loudly the game code before every game, some thing like,
I will never cover my sensors, I will play fair and paly smart....bla...bla.

My performance is not bad - 11 out 30. Actually it is very good. It's not easy to score since you may get tagged from any one around
you. Finally thanks Gavin for the lucky draw - the Starbucks gift card.

I did have a lot fun and enjoyed the outing today.
