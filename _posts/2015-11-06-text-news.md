As a software developer, especiall for those on Linux, have you ever thought reading news in your terminal? I used w3m in Emacs when I was in my previous workplace. I am tired of coniguring my Emacs again, so I decide to write one script to retrieve news from http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/. Only the latest news, that's enough for me.

Since I have used python3 and BeautifulSoup in one of my app years ago, it did not cost me too much time to get it done.
Here is the TextNews Demo version: https://github.com/tianlixu/TextNews

Refer to the project wiki on more details.

Look at the screenshot for how it looks like:

Now you don't have to worry about being caught by your boss. Enjoy it:)
