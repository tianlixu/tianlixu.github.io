# Necessary conditions
A deadlock situation on a resource can arise if and only if all the following conditions hold simultaneously in a system.

1. *Mutual exclusion*: The resources resolved must be unshareable; otherwise, the process would not be prevented from using the resource when necessary. Only one process can use the resource at any given instant of time.

2. *Hold and wait or resource holding*: a process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes.

3. *No preemption*: a resource can be released only volunttarily by the process holding it.

4. *Circular wait*: each process must be waiting for a resource which is being held by another process, which in turn is waiting for the first process to release the resource. In general, there is a set of waiting processes, P={P1, P2, ..., Pn}, such that P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, P2 is waiting for a resource held by p3 and so on until Pn is waiting for a resource held by P1.

These four conditions are known as the Coffman conditions.
