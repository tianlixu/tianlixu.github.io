I have some JPG images which are about 10M for each one.I need to covert them into PDF files and make each of them
less than 4M. Here is what I did on my Mac:

1. Open JPG file with Preview

2. File -> Export, then adjust the "Quality" option to make sure that the output will be less than 4M.

3. Save it.

4. Open the compressed JPG file with Preview

5. File -> Export as PDF, then save it.

6. Check the size and quality of the final file.


To convert multiple JPGs into one single PDF:

1. Open JPGs in Preview(may need to reduce the JPG size first)
2. Select all JPGs in Preview and select File -> Print -> PDF -> Save as PDF.
3. That's it.

If you have a better solution to do this, please make a comment:)
