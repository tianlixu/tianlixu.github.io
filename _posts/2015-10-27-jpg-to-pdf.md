I have some JPG images which are about 10M for each one.I need to covert them into PDF files and make each of them
less than 4M. Here is what I did on my Mac:

1. Open JPG file with Preview

2. File -> Export, then adjust the "Quality" option to make sure that the output will be less than 4M.

3. Save it.

4. Open the compressed JPG file with Preview

5. File -> Export as PDF, then save it.

6. Check the size and quality of the final file.

If you have a better solution to do this, please make a comment:)
