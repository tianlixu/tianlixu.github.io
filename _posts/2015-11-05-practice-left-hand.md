Do you write with your left hand or right hand? Have you every thought doing things like drawing, wrting or holding your forks with another hand? Well, I am a right handed guy. From now, I decided practice using my left hand as much as possible.

This video teaches you how to write with your left hand including how to hold your pencil and how to adjust the paper position that can make you feel comfortable when writing with your left hand.

This video gives more advice and demonstration on left handed writing. There are even special pens designed for left-handlers. Interesting.

How do you think about it? Ugly, soso, good or awsome?

Let's wait and see how it will look like one month later.
